-👋 Hi, I'm @shallitbeso (or you can call me Nico)!

-👀 I'm passionate about Computer Vision, especially interested in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering techniques.

-🌱 Currently diving into the world of **3D Gaussian Splatting**, exploring efficient algorithms to optimize memory usage.

-💞️ I'm looking forward to collaborating with fellow researchers or engineers interested in optimizing memory efficiency in 3D Gaussian Splatting methods.

-📫 Feel free to reach out via email: lh-zhang@m.scnu.edu.cn

-😄 Pronouns: Whatever works for you!

-🎶 Fun fact: In my spare time, you'll find me jamming to some blues guitar🎸.
